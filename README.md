# Challenge: Crypto Clustering

In this Challenge, I combined my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills.

I've created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different periods and plots the results to show the performance to the board visually.

I compared both Crypto percentage plots and PCA Crypto percentage plots and realized that using fewer features to cluster the data using k-means made the clusters appear more tightly grouped, the clusters also became more distinct and it was easier to spot outliers in clusters 1 and 3.

When finding the best value of k the PCA data did not differ from when using the original data in this instance, inertia decreases more slowly from value 4 of K!
