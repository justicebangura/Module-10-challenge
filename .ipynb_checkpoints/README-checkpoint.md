## Challenge: Crypto Clustering

![Crypto](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4627/files/3039054/download)

In this Challenge, I combined my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills.

Ive created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods, and plot the results so that we can visually show the performance to the board.

I compared both Crypto percentage plots and PCA Crypto percentage plot and realized that using fewer features to cluster the data using k-means made the clusters appear more tightly grouped, the clusters also became more distinct and it was easier to spot outliers in cluster 1 and and 3.

When finding the best value of k the PCA data did not differ from when using the original data in this instance, inertia decreases more slowly from value 4 of K!
